In the next section the program will capture the rest/zero position of the joystick, it is important to not move the stick otherwise the joystick will be offcenter.

### Applying calibration

This program kills and restarts a daemon called `trimui-inputd` which is responsible to convert the raw values of the sticks to virtual controller inside Linux. It is recommended to perform a reboot after each calibration.

## Compile

To compile you will need and aarch64 device or rootfs with the build essentials

>I personally use my [Sonic Pad rootfs creator](https://github.com/Jpe230/SonicPad-Debian/) for my dev enviroment (same SoC btw)

Additionally you will need to install the libraries for `SDL2` and `SDL2 TTF`

To compile:
```bash
make
```

The result will be located at `./build/TSP_Calibration`
